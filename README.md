Sass front end template


##Get started
It's easy to get started. Just follow the steps below.


###1.Download

Download Pintsize or install with bower

	$ bower install pintsize


###2. Install

Run Node Package Manager

	$ npm install


###3. Configure

Enter the pixel grid values used in your artwork in _variables.scss file. Done!

	$columns: 12;
    $column-width: 65px;
    $gutter-width: 20px;


###4. Build

Run Gulp

	$ gulp


##Basic usage

This is the default usage. The grid is calculated and classes are genrated for you to get building quickly.

	<div class="section">
 
        <div class="container">
 
            <div class="row">
                
                <div class="col w-6">
                    
                    A column with a width of 6 columns
 
                </div>
 
                <div class="col w-4 p-2">
                    
                    A column with a width of 4 columns
                    And pushed from the left a width of 2 columns
 
                </div>
 
            </div>
            
        </div>

	</div>


##Advanced usage

By setting the $advanced-usage variable in _variables.scss to 'true' you can work with Pintsize more semantically.

	//based on a 12 column grid
 
	.main-page-content {
	    
	    max-width: $grid-width; // calculated from your grid variables
	    margin: 0 auto;
	    padding: 0 1em;
	    @include clearfix;
	    
	}
	 
	.main-article {
	    
	    //default is 100% width on small devices
	    
	    //for devices larger than 640px
	    @include break-at(640px){
	        
	        @include columns(8);
	        
	    }
	    
	}
	 
	.popular-articles {
	    
	    //default is 100% width on small devices
	    
	    //for devices larger than 640px
	    @include break-at(640px) {
	        
	        @include columns(6, omega); // omega is used to remove the margin-right
	        
	    }
	    
	}
